Features
--------
 - Products Catalogue that display collection of product items for purchase.
 - User Login Page Portal that incorporates IAM (Identity Access Management) that redirects page access for users 
   according to roles, permission and privilege.

   ![roles Privilege Database Structure](/screenshots/roles_privileges_maintenance.PNG "Roles Privilege Table")
   
 - Shopping Cart that contains products added for checkout before it's translated to transactional order.
 - Upon login/sign-in, app is configured that incorporates Session-based Management authentication server that will create a session for 
   the user after the user logs in. The session id is then stored on a cookie on the userâ€™s browser.

  - Order History
  - Account Management

    ![User/Customer profile identity details (ie: phone number, password)](/screenshots/customer_profile.PNG "Customer Profile")
    
  - User Registration
    - Include forms validation checks on the user inputs (ie: phone number should contain numeric values, firstname or lastname should not contain numeric values,     
      password matching, email input should contain @ & dot (ie: xxxx@hotmail.com ) & so forth.
      In this way, it minimizes any back-end DB server side or data model validation throw-back errors.

###  Web-Security implemented using Spring Security Configuration

 -  Protecting against CSRF attacks


            @Bean

            public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

             http
    
            .csrf().disable();
    
            return http.build();
           }
  ![ Spring Security Configuration - Protecting against CSRF attacks](/screenshots/spring-security.PNG "Protecting against CSRF attacks")
    
- Spring provides two mechanisms to protect against CSRF attacks:

   - The Synchronizer Token Pattern 
   - Specifying the SameSite Attribute on your session cookie
     
- Synchronizer Token Pattern
The predominant and most comprehensive way to protect against CSRF attacks is to use the Synchronizer Token Pattern. This solution is to ensure that each HTTP request requires, in addition to our session cookie, a secure random generated value called a CSRF token be present in the HTTP request.

When an HTTP request is submitted, the server must look up the expected CSRF token and compare it against the actual CSRF token in the HTTP request. If the values do not match, the HTTP request should be rejected.

The key to this working is that the actual CSRF token should be in a part of the HTTP request that is not automatically included by the browser. For example, requiring the actual CSRF token in an HTTP parameter or an HTTP header will protect against CSRF attacks. Requiring the actual CSRF token in a cookie does not work because cookies are automatically included in the HTTP request by the browser.

     ### Synchronizer Token Form
     
     <form method="post"
          	action="/transfer">
          <input type="hidden"
          	name="_csrf"
          	value="4bfd1575-3ad1-4d21-96c7-4ef2d9f86721"/>
          <input type="text"
          	name="amount"/>
          <input type="text"
          	name="routingNumber"/>
          <input type="hidden"
          	name="account"/>
          <input type="submit"
          	value="Transfer"/>
    </form>
    
 - We can relax the expectations to require only the actual CSRF token for each HTTP request that updates the state of the application. For that to work, our application must ensure that safe HTTP methods are idempotent. This improves usability, since we want to allow linking to our website from external sites. Additionally, we do not want to include the random token in HTTP GET, as this can cause the tokens to be leaked.
