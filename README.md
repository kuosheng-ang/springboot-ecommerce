    - Include forms validation checks on the user inputs (ie: phone number should contain numeric values, firstname or lastname should not contain numeric values,     
      password matching, email input should contain @ & dot (ie: xxxx@hotmail.com ) & so forth.
      In this way, it minimizes any back-end DB server side or data model validation throw-back errors.
